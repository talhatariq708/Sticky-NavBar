# Sticky-NavBar
# HTML

I created a quick short project just to give you an idea about Sticky Nav Bar
This project was short that is why I am using only one HTML file instead of 3
It will show when you scroll down then the navBar will stick to the top position
And also when you scroll back up the navBar will back to the same position
